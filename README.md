### Project Overview

### Business Introduction
The bicycle industry has experienced significant growth due to increased awareness of health, sustainability, and urban mobility. However, not all customer groups demonstrate equal interest in bicycle purchases. By studying customer data, businesses can identify high-potential segments and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

### Business Problem
Many bicycle retailers struggle with identifying which customer groups are most likely to purchase a bike. Without this knowledge, marketing resources are often spread thin, leading to low conversion rates. Income level, lifestyle, and demographic background may all influence buying behavior, but these relationships are often not well understood.
### Analysis Objective
The primary objective is to:
- Investigate the role of income and other demographic factors in bicycle purchases.
- Segment the customer base into meaningful groups.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to support targeted marketing and improved sales performance.
### Process Taken

1. Data Understanding – Reviewed customer demographic dataset (marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, region, etc.).
2. Data Cleaning – Checked for missing values,duplicate values, inconsistencies, and outliers in the dataset.
3. Exploratory Analysis – Compared income levels and socioeconomic factors between bike buyers and non-buyers.
4. Segmentation – Grouped customers by income brackets, commute distance, and family composition.
5. Visualization – Built pivot tables and dashboards to display patterns and trends.

### Tools
- Microsoft Excel – For data preparation, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.
- Pivot Charts & Slicers – To visualize and segment data effectively.

### Key Insights

1. Customers with middle to high income levels show a higher tendency to purchase bicycles compared to lower-income groups.
2. Commute distance strongly influences purchase behavior — customers living within short to medium commute ranges (2–10 miles) are more likely to buy.
3. Age distribution reveals stronger purchase interest among working-age adults (35–50 years).
4. Education and occupation play a role: professionals and highly educated individuals show higher purchase rates.
5. Market segmentation highlights that urban professionals with moderate to high income are the most valuable target group.
